We have struggled to understand Lappland's personality. Some consider her simply mad, despite how polite and personable she can be in daily life. She actively seeks out people to converse with, indulging her taste for gallows humor, eager to see how her conversation partners will respond. Still, we know Lappland to be a dangerous element, and even at her most well-behaved, she remains frightening.
Lappland has been marked for close medical observation due to severe symptoms of Oripathy.
According to as yet unconfirmed reports, Lappland might have come from a certain family in Siracusa known for moving in certain dangerous circles, but scouring all active and inactive lists involving Siracusa failed to connect Lappland to any of the families. Because of the extreme risk involved in probing the Siracusan families, the investigation has been terminated. Lappland's Oripathy symptoms go beyond the physical to cause an abnormal obsession toward a certain target of hers, even spurring her to excessive violence.
Although Rhodes Island has exerted some degree of control over her behavior while deployed, she still does more or less whatever she wants in battle, which has been a problem for coordinated operations with her teammates.
Lappland's rather unique symptoms seem to enhance her fighting abilities—very rare among Infected. Her weapon, a specially designed eastern-style sword, complements her Arts. She appears to wield her Originium power untrained, through raw talent alone. Even though Lappland's powers decay rapidly when released, her deceptive fighting style and explosive offensive abilities have allowed her to master her weaknesses.
Furthermore, Lappland's uncanny ability to discern weakness neutralizes virtually any advantage an opponent with Originium power or other special ability may have. She is able to counter her enemy's attacks completely after only a few moments of observation.  Based on scattered reports and eyewitness accounts, Operator Lappland has a close personal connection to Penguin Logistics employee Texas, a liaison from the company to Rhodes Island. Texas, for her part, makes a concerted effort to avoid contact with Lappland. Still, in situations where they were forced to work together, Lappland has not gone out of her way to antagonize Texas. In fact, she seems to be taking some degree of pleasure in Texas playing hard-to-get, as it were.
Lappland treats other PL personnel cordially, but they have not warmed to her, and their meetings are always rather awkward (though thankfully rare).
Lappland tries to get along with other Rhodes Island Operators, as long as no one gets in her way.
[Classified Log]
All Lupus Operators display a guarded reaction to Operator Projekt Red's presence, with Operator Lappland exhibiting the most intense, most uncontrollable aura of dread and animosity, as well as inexplicable-euphoria. Until a solution is devised to mitigate the tension, keeping the two separated is advised.  [Classified Log]

In the future, you may want to think carefully about how you handle Lappland.
She's a lone wolf (note: this is Lupus slang for a Lupo ostracized from the community) who's been hurt. She's lost her family and will never truly be a part of another one.
You don't need to know what's been keeping her alive till now, and you can try to heal her wounds, but remember this: Madness can never be healed.
Nothing in her past should happen again.
If you still decide to keep her around, you'll ultimately be faced with a choice... Maybe you're not yet mentally ready to fight her.
So please, listen to my advice again: For your sake and the sake of those you care about, do choose wisely.  Lappland Saluzzo the bloodthirsty Infected Siracusan Lupo is the daughter of Alberto Saluzzo, the current don of the powerful Saluzzo famiglia, who despises her to be an untamed beast due to her maniacal, unhinged behavior. During the annihilation of the Texas famiglia seven years ago (the year 1092), Lappland led her squad to conduct the purge, but she later defied her father's order when she suddenly became obsessed with Cellinia Texas, the sole survivor of the family, and wished to challenge her in a duel. As a matter of fact, Alberto banished her from the family forever and labeled her as a "lone wolf" — a Lupine outcast. Even then, her banishment does not stop her craving to have another duel with Cellina, whom she sees as a "coward" in her eyes, and bring "the old Texas" back in the process.

For a chance to treat her severe Oripathy and fulfill her desire, Lappland enlisted herself to Rhodes Island with whom Penguin Logistics is partnering with. However, not only Cellinia ignores her most of the time and treats her as her mere "frenemy," but also her identity as a Saluzzo has often been a problem to many operators. Because of this, R.I. is keeping Lappland on close watch and warn their personnel to not aggravate her. Notably, they give warning to specific ones who possess connection with Siracusa such as Projekt Red the "Wolf Hunter" and a "Fang" of "Grandma", and Lisa aka. Suzuran whose mother hails from a certain famiglia.  Il Siracusano

Lappland was once the "playmate" of a young Cellinia Texas, who was sent to Siracusa to revisit her roots, raised to near-perfection in her youth. While not exactly friends nor enemies, they would often be competitive at things. Cellinia somehow obscured Lappland in being "the perfect Siracusan" despite being Columbian herself, and this led Lappland to resent everything Siracusan.

Things changed when the Giuseppe-led Texas famiglia later severed ties with Siracusa, in which Lappland herself led the Saluzzo branch of the Siracusan coalition aimed to exterminate the Texas famiglia from the face of Terra, and this is where things ultimately soured for Alberto and her daughter, long decried to be unhinged and untamed; Lappland directly disobeyed orders, attempted to deal with Texas herself, causing her own famiglia to incurr heavy losses.

Disowned and banished as a result, she has since considered her father as an enemy and actively seeks for an opportunity to kill him. Apparently, Alberto felt the same way, and was merely restraining himself. Lappland was astounded to see Texas watch her own bloodline burn down, a figurative act of rebellion that long left an impression in the lone wolf, inspiring her to do the same thing, though she did not understand it at first.

At the return of Cellinia to Siracusa, Lappland followed her, hoping for the "old" Texas to finally resurface, and perhaps, be treated to a long-sought-after deathmatch. Interestingly, Lappland does not antagonize Cellinia and in fact comes to her aid, for as long as her own motives align. After all, if Lappland wanted Texas dead, nothing must come in the way of the two of them, her own closure, and the ultimate destruction of everything Siracusan.      "1911" is written on Lappland's belt which can be seen in her Elite 2 skin, referring to the year when the last known Newfoundland wolf which Lappland is based on was killed.
        This also makes Lappland draw an odd dichotomy with Texas, who is based on the now-extinct Texas wolf.
    Lappland's English dialogues are spoken in Italian accent, fitting her Siracusan origin. Even though Lappland is officially not a member of Penguin Logistics, she is often included part of it by the Arknights community due her close interactions with the P.L. members, especially Texas. Her illustrator Huanxiang Heitu will sometimes include her in illustrations on P.L. Lappland also first appeared in a Penguin Logistics trailer for the game, bleeding from her eye, “She's crazy! Patients like her are the most annoying to deal with. She's always so polite and cooperative when we're conducting tests, and even smiled while saying she'd take good care of herself as Medical suggested... And look what happened.......Can we just beat the daylights out of her, so we can treat her here uninterrupted for a month?？”
“You want to try?”
